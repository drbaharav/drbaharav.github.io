I am a retired High-tech executive with a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. I also spent a few years as CS professor in college. In the last few years I discovered the joy of teaching in High-School and coaching for math and computer-science competitions.
<br><br>
<b>Math competitions</b>: Focused on AMC-10 and AMC-12. More than 80% of my students qualified to AIME and beyond. Space permitting, I also accept AMC-8 students.
<br>
<b>Computer Science</b>: Focused on college students and High-School AP-CS.
<br>
<b>Linear algebra, Numerical analysis, Signal processing and similar subjects</b>: For college students or industry professional, on conulting base.
<br><br>

<h3>What is special about my coaching?</h3>

<ul>
<li>We start with *your* method of solution. Maybe with the help of hints, guidance, or whatever is needed to get you rolling. Later we discuss other methods of solution, and how they all fit together</li>
<li>Subjects covered are tailored to the students strnegthes and weaknesses</li>
<li>Manner of teaching (proofs, examples, theory, project based) is adpated to student style</li>
<li>Weekly homework, specific for each student's needs. These include general practice, theme specific, and exploring new subjects</li>
<li>Email communication for hints and help during the week when you work on the homework</li>
