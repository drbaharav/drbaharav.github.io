I am a retired High-tech executive veteran, past professor for CS, with Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. In recent years I discovered the joys of teaching in High-School and coaching for math and computer-science competitions.
<br>
<b>Math competitions</b>: Focused on AMC-10 and AMC-12. Vast majority of my students proceed to AIME and beyond. Space available, I also accept AMC-8 students.
<br>
<b>Computer Science</b>: Focused on college students and High-School AP-CS.
<br><br>
